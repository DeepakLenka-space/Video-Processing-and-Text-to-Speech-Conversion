# Video-Processing-and-Text-to-Speech-Conversion

YouTube Video Processing and Text-to-Speech Conversion Project
This project is designed to perform a series of operations integrating various Python libraries and APIs. The main functionalities include downloading a video from YouTube, extracting its frames, generating descriptive text and a voiceover script using OpenAI's GPT-4 model, converting this script into speech, and finally combining the audio with the original video.

Features
Download videos from YouTube.
Process video frames using OpenCV.
Utilize OpenAI's GPT-4 model for text and script generation.
Convert text to speech using OpenAI's text-to-speech API.
Merge audio and video.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
OpenCV
PyTube
OpenAI
Requests
MoviePy
GDown (optional, for Google Drive downloads)
Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai opencv-python pytube requests moviepy gdown
Setting Up
OpenAI API Key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI and replace 'sk-' with your actual API key in the code.
YouTube URL: Replace 'https://youtu.be/x5wkIewzyNg?si=Si8ZARsm2IExr56I' with the URL of the YouTube video you want to process.
Running the Project
Download and Process Video: The script will download the video from the specified YouTube URL and process its frames.

Generate Descriptions and Scripts: Using the extracted frames, the script sends requests to OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate descriptions and a voiceover script.

Text-to-Speech Conversion: The generated script is then converted into speech using OpenAI's text-to-speech API.

Combine Audio and Video: The audio file generated from the script is merged with the original video.

Detailed Steps
Video Download and Frame Extraction:

The video is downloaded from YouTube.
Frames are extracted and processed using OpenCV.
Generating Descriptions and Scripts with OpenAI:

Frames are sent to OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
Descriptions and a voiceover script are generated.
Converting Script to Speech:

The script is sent to OpenAI's text-to-speech API.
The speech is saved as an MP3 file.
Merging Audio with Video:

The original video and the generated audio are combined using MoviePy.
The final video is saved with the new voiceover.
Note
Keep your API keys and sensitive data secure.
Adjust script parameters (frame extraction rate, voice style, etc.) as needed.
Troubleshooting
Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
Check API key validity and usage limits.
For ffmpeg errors with MoviePy, ensure ffmpeg is correctly installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
License
