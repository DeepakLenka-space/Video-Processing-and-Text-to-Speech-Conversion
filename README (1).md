Video Processing and Text-to-Speech Conversion
This project demonstrates a Python-based workflow for downloading a video from YouTube, processing its frames, generating a voiceover script using OpenAI's GPT-4 model, converting this script into speech, and finally combining the audio with the original video.

Features
Video Downloading: Downloads a video from a specified YouTube URL.
Frame Processing: Extracts frames from the video for analysis.
Script Generation: Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate a script based on the video frames.
Text-to-Speech: Converts the generated script into speech using OpenAI's text-to-speech API.
Audio-Video Merging: Combines the generated speech audio with the original video.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
PyTube (pytube)
OpenAI (openai)
Requests (requests)
MoviePy (moviepy) for combining audio and video
GDown (Optional for downloading files from Google Drive)
Installation
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai opencv-python pytube requests moviepy gdown
Usage
Set up the OpenAI API key: Replace 'sk-' with your actual OpenAI API key in the script.
Download the Video: Modify the youtube_url variable with the YouTube link of the video you want to download.
Process Video Frames: The script will process and extract frames from the downloaded video.
Generate Script and Convert to Speech: The script uses OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate a voiceover script and then converts it to speech.
Combine Audio and Video: Finally, the script merges the generated audio with the original video.
Example
After setting up, run the script. The process involves:

Downloading a video from YouTube.
Extracting and displaying frames.
Generating a voiceover script.
Converting the script to speech.
Merging the speech with the video.
The final output will be a video file with the new voiceover.

Note
Ensure your OpenAI API key and Google Drive links (if used) are kept secure.
The script parameters can be adjusted based on the requirements (e.g., frame rate, voice style).
